# Turn Your Agency Into a Scalable SaaS Powerhouse

<!-- Test comment - if you see this, hot reload is working! -->

We build (AI) SaaS for Digital Agencies (doing $1M+/yr), whether to sell to other agencies (white-label) or productize your services and sell directly to customers.

## Your Agencyâ€™s Problem

You've built a successful agency, but...

- 75% of your revenue depends on YOU being involved in every project
- **Your team spends 40+ hours/week (costing you $8,000+/mo) on repetitive, manual tasks**
- Your agency valuation multiple is capped at 1â€“2x revenue due to service-heavy operations

## The New Opportunity

What if your agency could:

- âœ… Generate 40% of revenue from recurring SaaS subscriptions
- âœ… Save $250k+ annually through automation ($1M/yr sounds nice until you realize you actually only take home low 6 figuresâ€¦)
- âœ… Scale without hiring proportionally more staff
- âœ… Command 3-5x higher valuations

In two years, the only agencies left standing will be those offering clients their own proprietary SaaS tools. Everyone else will become a reseller for someone elseâ€™s software.

## Your ROI Projection

**The Two Levers of Return:** Efficiency + Revenue

We canâ€™t guarantee exact revenue (markets vary), but we can guarantee measurable efficiency gains â€” your team is already leaking ~$8,000+/mo in automatable tasks. Thatâ€™s $100+,000/year back in capacity, without a single new client.

And while efficiency pays for the project on its own, the real upside is in SaaS revenue and enterprise value multiples.

## Conservative 12-Month Forecast

**Efficiency Gains:**

~$100,000/yr saved in staff time and overhead

**SaaS Revenue Projections (at a conservative $200/month per client):**

Month 6: $2,000/month from 10 clients

Month 9: $6,000/month from 30 clients

Month 12: $10,000/month from 50 clients

**Total Year 1 Financial Impact:**

~$100,000 efficiency gains

~$72,000 first-year SaaS revenue

$172,000 total impact on a $45,000 investment (and we wonâ€™t stop there!)

**Payback Period:** 4â€“6 months from efficiency gains alone.
