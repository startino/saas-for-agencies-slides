# Ready to stop selling time?

Your partner to productize your services and automate workflows‚Äîso revenue and margins grow.

## Your agency‚Äôs challenges

You've built a successful agency, but...

- üë®‚Äçüíº 75% of your revenue depends on YOU being involved in every project
- üí∏ Your team spends 40+ hours/week (costing you $8,000+/mo) on repetitive, manual tasks
- üìâ Your agency valuation multiple is capped at 1‚Äì2x revenue due to service-heavy operations
- üí§ No passive income ‚Äî revenue resets monthly

## The New Opportunity

In two years, the only agencies left standing will be those offering clients their own proprietary SaaS tools. Everyone else will become a reseller for someone else's software.

What if your agency could:

- ‚úÖ Create a new recurring income stream
- ‚úÖ Build a long‚Äëterm product asset your clients rely on
- ‚úÖ Automate delivery and operations end‚Äëto‚Äëend
- ‚úÖ Increase enterprise value and valuation multiple

## A SaaS will give you

- An asset that allows you to step off the endless treadmill
- A new recurring income stream
- No stress about whether you‚Äôll have any profit
- Proprietary technology that makes you better than competitors
