# Scale Your Agency with a SaaS

**We build & Monetise (AI) SaaS for Digital Agencies (doing $1M+/yr)**

Whether to sell to other agencies (white-label) or productize your services and sell directly to customers.

## Your Agency's Problem

You've built a successful agency, but...

- 👨‍💼 75% of your revenue depends on YOU being involved in every project
- 💸 Your team spends 40+ hours/week (costing you $8,000+/mo) on repetitive, manual tasks
- 📉 Your agency valuation multiple is capped at 1–2x revenue due to service-heavy operations
- 💤 No passive income — revenue resets monthly; SaaS compounds with MRR

## The New Opportunity

In two years, the only agencies left standing will be those offering clients their own proprietary SaaS tools. Everyone else will become a reseller for someone else's software.

What if your agency could:

- ✅ Create a new recurring income stream
- ✅ Build a long‑term product asset your clients rely on
- ✅ Automate delivery and operations end‑to‑end
- ✅ Increase enterprise value and valuation multiple

## Your ROI Projection

We can't guarantee exact revenue, but we can guarantee insane efficiency gains — your team is already leaking ~$8,000+/mo in automatable tasks. That's $100+,000/year back in capacity, without a single new client.

And while efficiency pays for the project on its own, the real upside is in SaaS revenue and enterprise value multiples.

### Conservative 12-Month Forecast

- ⚡ **Efficiency Gains:** ~$100,000/yr saved in staff time and overhead
- 💰 **First-Year SaaS Revenue:** ~$50,000 (conservative projection)
- 📈 **Enterprise Valuation Multiple:** 1-3x → 4-10x EBITDA valuation increase
- 🚀 **$150,000 First Year Impact**

**Payback Period:** 4–6 months from efficiency gains **alone**
